    <h3>Brexit</h3>

    <p>
    The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union is widely known as Brexit, a portmanteau of "British exit". Following a referendum held on <b>23 June 2016</b> in which 52% of votes were cast in favour of leaving the EU, the UK government intends to invoke Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, the formal procedure for withdrawing, by the end of March 2017. This, within the treaty terms, would put the UK on a course to leave the EU by March 2019.

    <h3> Inmediate effects of the BREXIT Referendum</h3>

    <p>
    Only one month after the BREXIT Referendum <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/22/one-month-on-what-is-the-impact-of-the-brexit-vote-so-far">several effects were reported</a>, three of the most important were: (1) the FTSE 100 shrugged off, (2) the value of pound collapsed, and (3) Reported incidents of race hate crimes increased considerable the week before and the week after the vote to leave the EU.

    <h3> Exploring street-level crime incidents in England and Wales before and after BREXIT</h3>

    <p>
    Since BREXIT seems to have had a direct effect over Hate Crimes, this kind of crime may not be the only one evidencing some effect related with the vote for leaving the EU. The following Data Visualization presents Street Level Crime and neighbourhood policing information from all forces in England and Wales to the Public. The Graphics allow to explore Crime Incidents filtering by County and Type of Crime.
