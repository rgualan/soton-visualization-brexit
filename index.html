            <h3>Brexit</h3>

            <p>
                As a significantly complex process Brexit has an impact in almost every field of political, economical or social fields of life. There were a whole range of reasons for separation from the rest of Europe â€“ from economical independence to immigration issues, and still there were reasons to stay in the Union. So the results of <b>23 June</b> was not a big surprise. However, the referendum held to decide whether the country should remain a member of the European Union or leave it caused ambiguous feedback in the society.
