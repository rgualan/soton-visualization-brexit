# Data Visualization - BREXIT

This repository contains the source code for a simple visualization entitled: "Impact on the level of hate crimes in England and Wales". [DC.js](https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/) was used to handle the interactions. Dc.js depends on [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) and [crossfilter](http://square.github.io/crossfilter/). These libraries allow highly efficient exploration on large multi-dimensional datasets.
